<h2> It is important to educate yourself in the issues that have been prevalant in Syria for the past several years.
On this page, we discuss the general problem of what is going on and provide answers to questions people are afraid to ask. </h2>
 
		<dt class= "heading4"> What is Syria? </dt>
		<dd class= "heading3"> A country bordering the Meditteranean Sea, Syria is home to 22 million ethnically diverse people.
		Majority of Syrians are Arab and follow the Sunni branch of Islam.  It history goes back thousands of years however, it is currently going through on
		of its most deadliest wars.</dd> 
		<br>
		<dt class= "heading4"> How did it start? </dt>
		<dd class= "heading3"> In 2011, peaceful protests against the dictatorship running the country, irrationaly backfired by the corrupt Syrian Government.
		The activists were soon getting killed off left and right in order to "send a message".  As a result of this, civilians decided it was time to fight back.
		Rebel groups formed and the Sryian army swarmed into civilians homes and did their best to wipe out any traces of the rebels.  Innocent women and children
		were being killed as well.  Other people from bordering countries joined with the rebels to take down the government.  As of now, there is no end to this mayhem.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt class= "heading4"> Chemical Weapons </dt>
		<dd class= "heading3"> Other countries have become outraged in light of accusations towards the Syrian Government of unleashing chemical weapons to their 
		own civilians.  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as well as the UN have attempted to remove Syria's chemical weapon arsenal.
		Despite this, more documentation shows homemade chemical weapons being used as attacks against rebel-held villages.  </dd>
		<br>
		<dt class= "heading4"> What is happening to the civilians? </dt>
		<dd class= "heading3"> According to the United Nations, about 200,000 people have been killed by January 2015.  The number has risen by 100,000 from 2013.
		Many of these innocent lives had nothing to do with the uprisings. It is reported that over 12,000 children and 8,000 women have been killed.
		<a href="refugees.html"> Refugees </a> have been fleeing Syria in order to search for a safe place to live.  Others are unable to leave because they are
		trapped from forces such as Syrian Government, ISIS, and others are controlling borders resisting people from escaping. </dd>
		<br>
		<dt class= "heading4"> Whats in the future for Syria? </dt>
		<dd class= "heading3"> Unfortunately, no current positive outlook can be seen at this point in the war. Refugees are constantly fleeing their country in hopes
		seek refuge from all the killing.  What was once a rich and celebrated culture as turned into shambles.  It is hard to imagine, but Syria will no longer be the same and will be left a broken country if this war will go on.</dd>
