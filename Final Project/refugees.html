		<dd class= "heading3"> Many surrounding countries of Syria are beginning to close their borders because the intake of Syrian refugees is becoming too much to handle. 
		However, many countries provide as much relief as they can for the refugees.  Germany will expect to resettle 800,000 Syrian refugees this year, with aid of $9.6 billion.
		France's President said that they would settle 24,000 migrants.  Even Australia plans to resettle 12,000 refugees from Syria and will donate $44 million to provide aid.
